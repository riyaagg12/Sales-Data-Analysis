**Sales Data Analysis Project**

In this project, I utilized **Power BI** to perform comprehensive sales data analysis for **ElectroHub**. The following tasks were completed:

- **Identified Key Products**: Analyzed the top and bottom 5 products based on sales, profit, and quantity sold.  
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Explored sales trends over various time periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, and annually).  
- **Sales and Profit Relationship**: Investigated the correlation between sales and profit to uncover actionable insights.  
- **Period Comparison**: Compared sales, profit, and quantity sold between any two user-selected time periods.  
- **Discount Analysis**: Calculated the average discount offered in each discount category.  
- **Order Metrics**: Determined the total number of orders and displayed detailed order metrics, including sales, profit, discount, net sales, and other relevant fields. These metrics were made filterable by product, date, customer ID, and promotion categories.  
- **Sales by City**: Visualized sales distribution across different cities.
